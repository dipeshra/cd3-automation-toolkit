## Introduction
CD3 stands for Cloud Deployment Design Deliverable.
The CD3 Automation toolkit has been developed to help in automating the OCI resource object management. 
<br><br>
It reads input data in the form of CD3 Excel sheets and generates the terraform files instead of handling the task through the OCI console manually. The toolkit also reverse engineers the components in OCI back to the Excel sheet and Terraform configuration. This generated Terraform code can be used by the OCI Resource Manager or leveraged by the organisationsâ€™ CI/CD processes.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites
* Git
* Any docker cli compatible platform such as Docker or Rancher.
* OCI Tenancy Access Requirement - 
Appropriate IAM policies must be in place for each of the resources that the user may try to create.
Minimum requirement for the user to get started is to have the ability to read to the tenancy.

### To clone the repo
* Open your terminal and change the directory to the one where you want to download the git repo.
* Run the git clone command as shown below:
       git clone https://github.com/oracle-devrel/cd3-automation-toolkit
* Once the cloning command completes successfully, the repo will replicate to the local directory. 

### To build an image

* Change directory to cd3-automation-toolkit(i.e. the cloned repo in your local).
* Run docker build -t cd3toolkit:${image_tag} -f Dockerfile --pull --no-cache .<br/>
<br  /><b>Note</b> : <i>${image_tag} should be replaced with suitable tag as per your requirements/standards.</i>

### To save the image (Optional)
* Run docker save cd3toolkit:${image_tag} | gzip > cd3toolkit_${image_tag}.tar.gz


### To run the CD3 container and exec into it
* Run docker run -it -d -v <path_in_local_system_where_the_files_must_be_generated>:/cd3user/tenancies <image_name>:<image_tag>
* Run docker ps
* Run docker exec -it <container_id> bash
